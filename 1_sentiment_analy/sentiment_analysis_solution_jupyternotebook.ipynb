    "Introduction: From the problem statement the required is as follows: F1-Score and Accuracy score\n",
    "for the given sentiment_analysis.txt. The file contains column0 which has corpus sentences and \n",
    "column1 which has the emotion for 0:Negative and 1:Positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given dataset is in the form of Labeled data, hence supervised learning is obvious for data. And\n",
    "pre-processing the data implementing Classification Algorithms is a good way to train\n",
    "and test models for this paticular dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps followed in this code assignment:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    A) Pre-Processing:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1) Tokenizing: The dataset is tokenized with 3 different tokenizers. Namely, Word_tokenizer,\n",
    "            Treebank_tokenizer and Regexp_tokenizer. And after that pre-processing step-2,3,4 are applied to\n",
    "            all the 3 tokenizers. \n",
    "        2) Removing the Stop words.\n",
    "        3) POS Tagging: It's resonable to do POS tagging after removing stop words as it'll remove\n",
    "            unimportant words, thus we have to process only important words: saving time and computation power.\n",
    "        4) After that lemmatization(WordNetLemmatizer is used in this assignment) is chosen over \n",
    "            stemmitization as it'll give the root word for any given word in the'\n",
    "        \n",
    "        5)Data Cleaning: Numbers,Hyphens,quotation marks,new line characters,apostrophes,etc \n",
    "            are removed from the txt.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note: I wanted to experiment with different tokenizers, lemmatizer,etc. The 3 different tokenizers \n",
    "    were considered, but only 1 lemmatizer was used throughout this project as the result from the\n",
    "    tokenizers were considerably similar, varying by 4-5% , So given the time constraint I \n",
    "    only tried to do implement the Naive Bayers Classifier in CBOW for 3 tokenizers. And for \n",
    "    remining only Treebank Tokenizer was used along with WordNetlemmatizer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    B) Splitting Dataset/Corpus:\n",
    "        The dataset/corpus is split into 66.6% of Training data and 33.3% of test data. \n",
    "        Moreover, the data is shuffledeverytime the code is re-run such that different instances \n",
    "        are shuffled between test and train datasets.\n",
    "    C) Feature Engineering: In order to run machine learning algorithms we need to convert \n",
    "    the text files into numerical feature vectors. Bag of Words (CountVectorizer()) is used\n",
    "    in 1st for Naive Bayers and Random Forest Algorithms. A term-Document Matrix was constructed \n",
    "    from the CountVectorizer() containing words or terms along columns and sentences along rows.\n",
    "    The bag of words only considers the count of words which is not a good practice for doing sentiment analysis. \n",
    "    Because some common words appear in many sentences which contain less importantnce. \n",
    "    Therefore,TF-IDF is used later in this assignment for Naive Bayers and Random Forest Algorithms\n",
    "    which takes into account the word based upon its uniqueness.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    D) Model Construction: MultiNomial Naive Bayers was constructed from sklearn.model_selection\n",
    "    library and Random Forest Classifier was constructed from sklearn.ensemble.\n",
    "    E) Evaluation: The accuracy_score, F1-scores are printed into the console. As well as confusion matrix is also calculated\n",
