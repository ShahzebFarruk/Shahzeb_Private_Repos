# Knowledge Graph + Text Classification
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61950234/115834369-28a90000-a3e3-11eb-9b62-7767173400a7.png)

This project aims to utililize power of trivial text classsification and apply the output of text classification to Knowledge Graphs in order to better classifiy the topics.
This project scraps the text documents (Corpus) from Wikipedia and then used NER(using neuralcoref & Spacy Lib) to extract the topics and forms triplets in subject->relation->predicate pairs. This output is classified and along side the knowledge embbedings being calculate for the construction of Knowledge Graph.
## How to run the codes
Open the noetbook and run the cell.
You may need to install the requirements.

The Projct is divided into two parts for this repo purposes.
Part-1 is the below Google Colab links for KG Generation and triplets.
PART-2 is for the Knowledge Embeddings used PyKeen pipeline to achieve RotatE, TranS , etc.
